                “Welcome back, Agent. The world needs you now more than ever.” – Charles Goodwin, Agency Director.
                Crackdown 3 features a brand new story Campaign that you can play alone or with a friend in two-player
                co-op over Xbox Live. Explore the dangerous streets and treacherous heights of the island metropolis,
                “New Providence”. Use your powerful Agent Skills and an arsenal of weapons and equipment to bring the
                leaders of the cruel and corrupt “TerraNova” corporation to justice. As the game begins, the whole world
                is in peril. “Blackout” attacks have thrown cities into chaos. Millions of refugees are on the move. And
                at the heart of the mystery… is a strange element known only as “Chimera”. Now it’s up to the Agency to
                liberate New Providence and stop the Blackout before the whole world plunges into darkness. Time to step
                it up, Agent! Along with the franchise favorite Agency Director, Crackdown 3 features an all-new cast of
                characters. These ruthless bosses of TerraNova will protect their divisions with everything they’ve got.
                When you hit them, they’ll punch back even harder, unleashing retaliatory attacks that can strike
                anywhere in New Providence. Destroy TerraNova assets to weaken the enemy bosses, assault their soaring
                towers, and terminate their employment.
                Wrecking Zone is Crackdown 3’s explosive multiplayer mode where two teams of 5 hyper-agile Agents fight
                for supremacy in cloud-powered arenas of unprecedented destruction. This is where you really step up
                your boom! The Agency is the world’s most elite law-enforcement unit, and the Wrecking Zone is its
                combat simulator, where Agents train with the best to be the best. Earn rewards and bragging rights as
                you test your mettle on multiple maps and modes. But that’s not all… Using the power of Azure Cloud
                Services and Xbox Live, Wrecking Zone enables fully destructible environments. Everything is an object
                you can break. No door? No problem. Use a rocket to blow a hole straight through a building! Enemies
                escaping across a skybridge? Unload with your minigun and take the whole bridge down! Want to topple a
                whole skyscraper on your enemies? You can do that—and more—in Wrecking Zone.
